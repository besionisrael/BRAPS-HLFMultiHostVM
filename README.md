# FabricMultiHostDeployment
This repository builds a network topology, as presented in the figure below, consists of 4 virtual machines. The first three virtual machines refer to a respective organization (Org1, Org2, Org3). Each organization thus runs its own components (nodes, certificate of authority...) in order to comply with a "multihost multi-organization" deployment. The fourth machine refers to an organization with orderer nodes (Orderer Org).
